# Guild Wars 2 - Scrolling Combat Text (GW2SCT)

This is an addon for arcdps by deltaconnected (https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/) and adds a highly customizable floating and scrolling combat text beside the users character. Incoming damage is displayed on the left side, outgoing damage is displayed on the right side.

### Prerequisites

GW2SCT requires ArcDPS to work. You can install arcdps by following the instructions in this site:
https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/

### Installing

Go to the the [release page](https://github.com/Artenuvielle/GW2-SCT/releases) and download the newest release. Copy the file "d3d9_arcdps_sct.dll" into the "bin64/"" subfolder of your game directory.

If you want to add your own fonts copy them in the "addons/sct/fonts/" subfolder of your game directory. You can configure the output in the arcdps options panel (opened by default with Alt+Shift+T).

If for some reason the addon is not loading for you, check that you have the newest version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables installed. Get it [here](https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).
